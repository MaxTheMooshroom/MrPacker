<hr />

Mr. Packer (Modrinth Packer, affectionately called "Mister Packer") is a graphical tool that
aims to create a cross-platform GUI for modpack development. It's called "Mr. Packer" because
of the file format "mrpack" generated by
[Modrinth's Theseus App](https://github.com/modrinth/code/blob/main/apps/app/README.md)
when exporting a created modpack, and it's used for packing a bunch of resources together
for an enhanced minecraft experience.
