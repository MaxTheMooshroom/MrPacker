Mr. Packer (Modrinth Packer) is a graphical tool that aims to create a
cross-platform GUI for modpack development. It's called "Mr. Packer" because
of the file format "mrpack" generated by
[Modrinth's Theseus App](https://github.com/modrinth/code/blob/main/apps/app/README.md)
when exporting a created modpack, and it's used for packing a bunch of
resources together for an enhanced minecraft experience.

### Goals

- [ ] address incorrect "env" variables for mod files in theseus' generated mrpacks
- [ ] generate separate server and client mrpacks (and a merged mrpack)
- [ ] provide an easy viewer for pack statistics and other information
- [ ] perform pack validation to look for any incompatibilities, dependency issues,
      and any other issue that may arise during pack development
- [ ] generate changelogs from one version to the next


### Milestones

- [ ] get a basic blockout graphic design for Mr. Packer done in figma (WIP)
- [ ] design
